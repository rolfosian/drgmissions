## **Deep Rock Galactic lua scripts for use with [RE-UE4SS lua API](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/) to fetch current mission and deep dive data for flask**

- To run DRG headless, use command line arg `-nullrhi` when running the game
- Make sure to [skip intro videos](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deep_Rock_Galactic#Skip_intro_videos) and use `-nosplash` command line arg
- Make sure to disable steam cloud saves to save time
- ~~Consider using [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) for even less overhead and easier automation for updates etc~~ - Doesn't work due to DRM
- Unzip UE4SS_Xinput_v2.5.2.zip in Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64 - this is also the CWD of the scripts run by the hook.
* [This script will collect all of the missions generated by DRG up until the date set by the target_date variable](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/long_term_mission_data_collector/Scripts/main.lua) Its corresponding python script for automated `mods.txt` and easy user input for setting the target date is [BulkMissions_Run.py](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/BulkMissions_Run.py). This python script goes in `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64\` The python interpreter is required to be run with administrator privileges with this script.
- The socket folder in [/mods/long_term_mission_data_collector/Scripts/x64](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/long_term_mission_data_collector/Scripts/x64) is also required in `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64` for this script to work
- `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD.exe` **AND** `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64\FSD-Win64-Shipping.exe` **AND ALSO** `Steam.exe` ARE **ALL** required to be run with administrator privileges in order for this script to be able to modify the system clock and run without errors!

* [This script will fetch the current DD data and exit the game in short order](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/dds_fetcher/Scripts/main.lua)
* [This script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/GetDailyDeals/Scripts/main.lua) and its [corresponding python script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/Daily_Trades_Run.py) will fetch all of the daily deals up until the date set by the user input in the python script. **UTC System Clock Timezone is required for this script, as are administrator privileges for the python script.** I tried to do it like the standard missions collector but the game would just hang after the second or third time the clock was changed, so this method restarts the game for every daily deal.
* ~~Make sure to turn off automatic time settings~~ The `.*_Run.py` python scripts will handle this
* If running the clock changing scripts in a VM, make sure to turn off guest/host timesync, IE: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#disabletimesync

## **TODO**
- ~~Contingencies for if the game doesn't terminate gracefully on 'organic' exit~~ Refer to kill process function in [this script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/DDs_Run.py)
- ~~Contingencies for if the game crashes~~
- ~~Loop script to actually launch the game and upload DD data to flask host weekly~~ Refer to [this script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/DDs_Run.py) and its corresponding [.bat](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/Run_DDs.bat) for Task scheduler info. I set a cron to run wakeonlan on my home server at 10:59 Thursday to send magic packets to wake a hardware tertiary machine I built out of old trash. Tested with a Windows 10 virtual machine using `-nullrhi` and it works also but is slow.
- Figure out a solution to reduce required delay between iterations for accurate data to be collected by the 30 minute incrementer
- Figure out how to manipulate wine(?) system clock with hook on linux
- Determine functions for loading into Deep Dive stages and scraping extra data such as Dreadnought types and BET-C? Idk, I don't like the idea of going too deep, it starts to feel like cheating at some point
- Clean up and convert Complexity/Length finalization to table lookup
- ~~Parallelize png rendering and arraying functions and change png route args to codenames instead of indexing once possible~~ Moved png rendering and arraying to thread pools, but the gains are miniscule because of thread management overhead and maybe the GIL or something, and also requires hard restart of interpreter so gunicorn --reload isn't feasible. Needs processing pool to see gains that are bigger than fractions of a millisecond, but the vps is only 1 vcore so I'm not going to bother.
- JS Functions in html to save page configuration and keep background/countdown hidden on refresh if they are hidden.
