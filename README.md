## **Deep Rock Galactic lua scripts for use with [RE-UE4SS lua API](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/) to fetch current mission and deep dive data for flask**

- To run DRG headless, use command line arg `-nullrhi` when running the game.
- Tested working with a Windows 10 virtual machine using `-nullrhi` (Requires OpenGL or dx11 for the UE4SS hook).
- Make sure to [skip intro videos](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deep_Rock_Galactic#Skip_intro_videos) and also use `-nosplash` command line arg if desired.
- Be sure to disable Steam cloud save synchronization.
- Unzip UE4SS into Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64 - this is also the CWD of the scripts run by the UE4SS hook.
* [This script will collect all of the missions generated by DRG up until the date set by the target_date variable](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/BulkMissionsScraper/Scripts/main.lua). Its corresponding python script for automated `mods.txt` and easy user input for setting the target date is [BulkMissions_Run.py](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/BulkMissions_Run.py). This python script goes in `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64\`. The python interpreter is required to be run with administrator privileges with this script.
- `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD.exe` **AND** `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64\FSD-Win64-Shipping.exe` **AND ALSO** `Steam.exe` **ARE ALL** required to be run with administrator privileges in order for this script to be able to modify the system clock and run without errors!

- [This script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/DailyDealsScraper/Scripts/main.lua) and its [corresponding python script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/DailyDeals_Run.py) will fetch all of the daily deals up until the date set by the user input in the python script. **UTC System Clock Timezone is required for this script, as are administrator privileges for the python interpreter.** 
- If running the clock changing scripts in a VM, make sure to turn off guest/host timesync, IE: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#disabletimesync

- The `.*_Run.py` python scripts will handle toggling the automatic time sync settings on and off.

- [This script will fetch the current Deep Dive data and exit the game in short order](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/DeepDivesScraper/Scripts/main.lua)
- ~~I have set a crontab entry: `59 10 * * 4 /usr/bin/wakeonlan XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` on my home server to automate this. (cron of course requires adjustment if system clock is not UTC). It sends magic packets to wake a junker hardware tertiary machine I built out of old trash every Thursday at 10:59 which in turn runs [this script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/DeepDives_Run.py) via [this .bat](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/Run_DeepDives.bat) and Task Scheduler On event - Log: System, Source: Microsoft-Windows-Power-Troubleshooter, Event ID: 1 (On wake from sleep). Requires automatic logon of administrator account. This of course could also be done with a Virtual Machine instead.~~ Now using a Win10 Virtual Machine, and running on startup via shortcut to [Run_DeepDives.bat](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/Run_DeepDives.bat) in startup folder, requires automatic login of Windows user and Steam at startup of course also.

## **TODO**
- **Public Enemy Number One**: Check and Update Deep Dive scraper weekly to accomodate currently unknown configurations (havent seen any unknowns in months), **contingencies for if Steam misbehaves**
- Scripts for registry entries for automatic login and cron entry for starting vm weekly for [DeepDives_Run.py](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/DeepDives_Run.py)
- Fix canvas mission icon jaggies in js
- Move static site to github pages, set up github actions for deployment of metadata and edit `.*_Run` scripts accordingly
- ~~Figure out a solution to reduce required delay between iterations for accurate data to be collected by the 30 minute incrementer~~
- Figure out how to manipulate wine(?) system clock with hook on linux
- ~~Clean up and convert Complexity/Length finalization to table lookup seriously look at it its so disgusting DO SOMETHING~~
- ~~Parallelize png rendering and arraying functions and change png route args to codenames instead of indexing once possible~~ Moved png rendering and arraying to thread pools, but the gains are miniscule because of thread management overhead, the GIL, and I/O bound image rendering. It also requires a hard restart of the interpreter so `gunicorn --reload` isn't feasible. Needs processing pools to see gains that are bigger than fractions of a millisecond, but the vps is only 1 vcore so I'm not going to bother debugging the circular multiprocessing import at this stage.
