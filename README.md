Readme is at the top of [main.lua](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/missiondatafetcher/Scripts/main.lua)

(Very) Rough draft: https://drgmissions.netlify.app/ all working, except It doesn't actually update yet. Waiting for sale and the upcoming season patch to make it operational, also im going to use rows instead of columns.

being a novice i dont really have any idea how commits or pulls or forks or anything work, i have done zero book learning on this matter
