## **Deep Rock Galactic lua scripts for use with [RE-UE4SS lua API](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/) to fetch current mission and deep dive data for flask**

- To run DRG headless, use command line arg `-nullrhi` when running the game.
- Tested working with a Windows 10 virtual machine using `-nullrhi` (Requires OpenGL or dx11 for the UE4SS GUI if you want to use it).
- Make sure to [skip intro videos](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deep_Rock_Galactic#Skip_intro_videos) and also use `-nosplash` command line arg if desired.
- Be sure to disable Steam cloud save synchronization.
- Unzip UE4SS into steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64 - this is also the CWD of the scripts run by the UE4SS hook.

* [This lua script will collect all of the missions generated by DRG up until the date set by the target_date variable](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/BulkMissionsScraper/Scripts/main.lua). Its corresponding python script for automated `mods.txt` and easy user input for setting the target date is [BulkMissions_Run.py](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/BulkMissions_Run.py). This python script goes in `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64\`. The python interpreter is required to be run with administrator privileges with this script.
- `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD.exe` **AND** `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64\FSD-Win64-Shipping.exe` **AND ALSO** `Steam.exe` **ARE ALL** required to be run with administrator privileges in order for this script to be able to modify the system clock and run without errors!

- [This lua script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/DailyDealsScraper/Scripts/main.lua) and its [corresponding python script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/DailyDeals_Run.py) will fetch 365 days worth of daily deals. Adjust the total_days variable in the lua script if you want more or less.

- If running the clock changing scripts in a VM, make sure to turn off guest/host timesync, IE: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#disabletimesync `VBoxManage setextradata VM-name "VBoxInternal/Devices/VMMDev/0/Config/GetHostTimeDisabled" 1`

- The `.*_Run.py` python scripts will handle toggling the system automatic time sync settings on and off.

- [This lua script will fetch the current Deep Dive data and exit the game in short order](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/mods/DeepDivesScraper/Scripts/main.lua)
- ~~I have set a crontab entry: `59 10 * * 4 /usr/bin/wakeonlan XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` on my home server to automate this. (cron of course requires adjustment if system clock is not UTC). It sends magic packets to wake a junker hardware tertiary machine I built out of old trash every Thursday at 10:59 which in turn runs [this script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/DeepDives_Run.py) via [this .bat (not the setup script but the script it generates)](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/vm_fresh_setup.bat#L176) and Task Scheduler On event - Log: System, Source: Microsoft-Windows-Power-Troubleshooter, Event ID: 1 (On wake from sleep). Requires automatic logon of administrator account. This of course could also be done with a Virtual Machine instead.~~ Now using a Win10 Virtual Machine, and running on startup via shortcut to [Run_DeepDives.bat (not the setup script but the script it generates)](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/vm_fresh_setup.bat#L176) in startup folder, requires automatic logon of Windows user and Steam at startup of course also.

## **Flask Service Setup**
- [This setup script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/flask/setup.py) will take care of the setup of python venv.
1. Clone the repo or copy the [flask directory](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/flask/) to your debian or ubuntu machine
2. `cd` into the `flask` directory and run `python3 setup.py`, then follow the prompts to set up the venv and systemd service + optional nginx reverse proxy.
- It will install the service/venv to the /home/`service_user`/`service_name` folder specified by user input. **Make Sure to note down the cfg.json it generates to copy to the scraper_cfg.json for the windows vm** or simply input your own manually. It includes a prompt for setting up an nginx reverse proxy plus logic for if you pick a domain name and want to use certbot for it also.
- Could do with some polishing but does the job well enough for now, cfg.json stuff is a bit wonky; probably better to handle those entirely manually.

## **Virtual Machine Setup**
1. Pick a VM Software (Virtualbox, VMWare, Qemu, etc) and install a Windows 10 machine. Give it at least 4 cores or it will run very poorly, and 4-8GB of ram.
2. Pick your poison of which version of Windows, I recommend LTSC 21H2, it's more forgiving on disabling updates and stuff and is just generally more lightweight than the other distros.
3. Make sure to turn off guest/host timesync if your chosen vm software has it; IE: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#disabletimesync `VBoxManage setextradata VM-name "VBoxInternal/Devices/VMMDev/0/Config/GetHostTimeDisabled" 1` **This is critical**
4. Have your [cfg.json](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/flask/cfg.json) ready from the flask server [setup](/README.md#flask-service-setup).
5. Run [This batch script](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/vm_fresh_setup.bat) on your new Windows VM and follow the prompts. 
- The batch script will handle enabling the automatic logon of the windows user account, disables UAC, as well as prompts for Windows GUI performance options plus sets the system clock timezone to UTC and the correct date format for the lua scripts. It will also download and install python + its requests and psutil modules before installing steam and setting all relevant executables to be run with elevated privileges via the registry, as well as disabling automatic Windows updates.
6. Make sure Steam auto logon is enabled, install Deep Rock Galactic, and set the launch options `-nullrhi` and `-nosplash` as well as [skip intro videos](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deep_Rock_Galactic#Skip_intro_videos)
7. Install the [mesa-dist-win msvc release](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases/) for enabling OpenGL on Qemu etc. Or, if running Virtualbox, you don't need this, you can just install the Virtualbox Guest Additions with 3d acceleration enabled and change [this](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/blob/main/assets/UE4SS-settings.ini#L98) to dx11. *only needed if you want to run the ue4ss console gui
8. Copy the `cfg.json` generated from the flask server setup as `scraper_cfg.json`, the `.*_Run.py` scripts, the `drgmissions_scraper_utils.py` library, and `drgmissions_validator.py` script to the `Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64` folder
9. Finally unzip [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/download/v3.0.1/UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip) into the `steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Binaries\Win64` and merge the [mods](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/tree/main/mods) folders.

## **TODO**
- **Public Enemy Number One**: Check and Update Deep Dive scraper weekly to accomodate currently unknown configurations (havent seen any unknowns in months), **contingencies for if Steam misbehaves**
- ~~[Scripts for registry entries for automatic login](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/vm_fresh_setup.bat) and [cron entry for starting vm weekly](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/vm_Run.sh) for [DeepDives_Run.py](https://github.com/rolfosian/drgmissions/blob/main/DeepDives_Run.py)~~
- Fix canvas mission icon jaggies in js
- Move static site to github pages, set up github actions for deployment of metadata and edit `.*_Run` scripts accordingly
- ~~Figure out a solution to reduce required delay between iterations for accurate data to be collected by the 30 minute incrementer~~
- Figure out how to manipulate wine(?) system clock with hook on linux
- ~~Clean up and convert Complexity/Length finalization to table lookup seriously look at it its so disgusting DO SOMETHING~~
- ~~Parallelize png rendering and arraying functions and change png route args to codenames instead of indexing once possible~~
